<h3>These soft pretzels are soft and chewy on the inside, but wonderfully crispy and salty on the outside. Plus, the recipe comes together with basic ingredients you probably already have on hand!</h3>

<ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F)</li>
        <li>4 Teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup baking soda</li>
        <li>4 cups hot water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup kosher salt, for topping</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <!--Step 1-->
    <li>Pour 1 ¼ cups warm water into a medium bowl. Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <!--Step 2-->
    <li>Mix flour, ½ cup sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add yeast mixture and oil. Mix well and form into a dough. If mixture is dry, add one or two more tablespoons of water.</li>
    <!--Step 3-->
    <li>Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
    <!--Step 4-->
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.</li>
    <!--Step 5-->
    <li>Pour 4 cups hot water into a large bowl. Stir in baking soda until dissolved; set aside.</li>
    <!--Step 6-->
    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope and twist into a pretzel shape.</li>
    <!--Step 7-->
    <li>Once all of the dough is shaped, dip each pretzel into the baking soda-hot water solution and place on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with kosher salt.</li>
    <!--Step 8-->
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <!--Step 9(Last Step)-->
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
